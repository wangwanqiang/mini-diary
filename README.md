### Adding missing translations

The list of all English strings can be found in [`en.ts`](./src/main/i18n/translations/en.ts). If there are translations missing for your language and you'd like to help with the translation, you can add the translated strings to your language's file in [`src/main/i18n/translations`](./src/main/i18n/translations) and submit a PR.

### Adding a new language

If the app isn't translated into your language yet and you'd like to help out, you can easily add translations with the following steps:

1. The translation files can be found in [`src/main/i18n/translations`](./src/main/i18n/translations). Duplicate the [`en.ts`](./src/main/i18n/translations/en.ts) file as `[LANG].ts`, where `[LANG]` is the [shortcode of your language](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/locales).
2. In the file you just created, replace the English translations with your own.
3. Import your file in the `ALL_TRANSLATIONS` object in [`src/main/i18n/i18n.ts`](./src/main/i18n/i18n.ts).
4. Add your language shortcode to the `electronLanguages` array in [`package.json`](./package.json).
5. Run the app in your language (see the steps [above](#development)) and make sure that the translations fit into the app (e.g. that they aren't too long for input fields).
6. Submit a PR. Thanks for your help!
